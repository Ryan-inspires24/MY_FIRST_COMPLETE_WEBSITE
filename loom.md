#  Progress and Next Steps

##  Progress So Far

- **Unified User Model**  
  Refactored the separate `Client` and `Vendor` classes into a single, more efficient `User` model to simplify user management.

- **Rebuilt Authentication Forms**  
  Reconstructed the **Login** and **Registration** forms to reflect the new `User` model and updated database structure.

- **Template Refactoring**  
  Updated all templates that referenced the old models to use the new `User` structure.

- **Database Enhancements**  
  Added new tables for future features like admin controls and activity tracking.

- **Vendor Comments Section**  
  Successfully implemented a dynamic comment system for vendors that updates the UI and database when a user posts a comment.

- **Product Details Page**  
  Completed and styled the `product_details` page to display individual product information.

- **Product Comments Section (Not Functional Yet)**  
  Frontend is ready, but the backend logic is still not working. Needs debugging.
